[{"body":"This document describes the network topology of Porter in BGP mode and how Porter functions in BGP mode.\nNetwork Topology The following figure shows the topology of the network between a Kubernetes cluster where Porter is installed and a peer BGP router.\nIP addresses and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) in the preceding figure are examples only. The topology is described as follows:\n A service backed by two pods is deployed in the Kubernetes cluster, and is assigned an IP address 172.22.0.2 for external access. Porter installed in the Kubernetes cluster establishes a BGP connection with the BGP router, and publishes routes destined for the service to the BGP router. When an external client machine attempts to access the service, the BGP router load balances the traffic among the master, worker 1, and worker 2 nodes based on the routes obtained from Porter. After the service traffic reaches a node, kube-proxy can further forward the traffic to other nodes for load balancing (both pod 1 and pod 2 can be reached over kube-proxy).  Porter uses GoBGP (integrated in Porter) to establish a BGP connection for route publishing. Two CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs), BgpConf and BgpPeer, are provided for users to configure the local and peer BGP properties on Porter. BgpConf and BgpPeer are designed according to the GoBGP API.

However, BGP may be unavailable in certain systems because of security requirements or because the router does not support BGP. In this case, you can use Porter in Layer 2 mode to achieve similar functionality.\nNetwork Topology The following figure shows the topology of the network between a Kubernetes cluster with Porter and a router.\nIP addresses and MAC addresses in the preceding figure are examples only. The topology is described as follows:\n A service backed by two pods is deployed in the Kubernetes cluster, and is assigned an IP address 192.168.0.91 for external access. The service IP address is on the same network segment as the cluster node IP addresses. Porter installed in the Kubernetes cluster randomly selects a node (worker 1 in this example) to handle service requests. After that, Porter sends an ARP/NDP packet to the router, which maps the service IP address to the MAC address of worker 1. If multiple porter-manager replicas have been deployed in the cluster, Porter uses the the leader election feature of Kubernetes to ensure that only one replica responds to ARP/NDP requests. When an external client machine attempts to access the service, the router forwards the service traffic to worker 1 based on the mapping between the service IP address and the MAC address of worker 1. After the service traffic reaches worker 1, kube-proxy can further forward the traffic to other nodes for load balancing (both pod 1 and pod 2 can be reached over kube-proxy). If worker 1 fails, Porter re-sends an APR/NDP packet to the router to map the service IP address to the MAC address of worker 2, and the service traffic switches to worker 2.  NOTE\nThe Layer 2 mode has two limitations:\n Worker 1 and worker 2 work in active-standby mode in terms of traffic forwarding. When a failover occurs, services in the Kubernetes cluster will be interrupted for a short while. All service traffic is always sent to one node first and then forwarded to other nodes over kube-proxy in a second hop. Therefore, the service bandwidth is limited to the bandwidth of a single node, which causes a bandwidth bottleneck.

The BgpConf, BgpPeer, Eip, deployment and service described in this document are examples only and you need to customize the commands and YAML configurations based on your requirements.\nInstead of using a real router, this document uses a Linux server with BIRD to simulate a router so that users without a real router can also use Porter in BGP mode for tests.\nPrerequisites   You need to prepare a Kubernetes cluster where Porter has been installed. For details, see Install Porter on Kubernetes (kubectl and Helm) and Install Porter on KubeSphere (Web Console).\n  You need to prepare a Linux server that communicates with the Kubernetes cluster properly. BIRD will be installed on the server to simulate a BGP router.\n  If you use a real router instead of BIRD, the router must support BGP and Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing. In addition, the router must also support receiving multiple equivalent routes from the same neighbor.\n  This document uses the following devices as an example:\n   Device Name IP Address Description     master1 192.168.0.2 Kubernetes cluster master, where Porter is installed.   worker-p001 192.168.0.3 Kubernetes cluster worker 1   worker-p002 192.168.0.4 Kubernetes cluster worker 2   i-f3fozos0 192.168.0.5 BIRD machine, where BIRD will be installed to simulate a BGP router.    Step 1: Install and Configure BIRD If you use a real router, you can skip this step and perform configuration on the router instead.\n  Log in to the BIRD machine and run the following commands to install BIRD:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:cz.nic-labs/bird sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install bird sudo systemctl enable bird NOTE\n BIRD 1.5 does not support ECMP. To use all features of Porter, you are advised to install BIRD 1.6 or later. The preceding commands apply only to Debian-based OSs such as Debian and Ubuntu. On Red Hat-based OSs such as RHEL and CentOS, use yum instead. You can also install BIRD according to the official BIRD documentation.     Run the following command to edit the BIRD configuration file:\nvi /etc/bird/bird.conf   Configure the BIRD configuration file as follows:\nrouter id 192.168.0.5; protocol kernel { scan time 60; import none; export all; merge paths on; } protocol bgp neighbor1 { local as 50001; neighbor 192.168.0.2 port 17900 as 50000; source address 192.168.0.5; import all; export all; enable route refresh off; add paths on; } NOTE\n  For test usage, you only need to customize the following fields in the preceding configuration:\nrouter id: Router ID of the BIRD machine, which is usually set to the IP address of the BIRD machine.\nprotocol bgp neighbor1:\n local as: ASN of the BIRD machine, which must be different from the ASN of the Kubernetes cluster. neighbor: Master node IP address, BGP port number, and ASN of the Kubernetes cluster. Use port 17900 instead of the default BGP port 179 to avoid conflicts with other BGP components in the system. source address: IP address of the BIRD machine.    If multiple nodes in the Kubernetes are used as BGP neighbors, you need to configure multiple BGP neighbors in the BIRD configuration file.\n  For details about the BIRD configuration file, see the official BIRD documentation.\n      Run the following command to restart BIRD:\nsudo systemctl restart bird   Run the following command to check whether the status of BIRD is active:\nsudo systemctl status bird NOTE\nIf the status of BIRD is not active, you can run the following command to check the error logs:\njournalctl -f -u bird     Step 2: Create a BgpConf Object The BgpConf object is used to configure the local (Kubernetes cluster) BGP properties on Porter.\n  Run the following command to create a YAML file for the BgpConf object:\nvi porter-bgp-conf.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\napiVersion:network.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2kind:BgpConfmetadata:name:defaultspec:as:50000listenPort:17900routerId:192.168.0.2NOTE\nFor details about the fields in the BgpConf YAML configuration, see Configure Local BGP Properties Using BgpConf.    Run the following command to create the BgpConf object:\nkubectl apply -f porter-bgp-conf.yaml   Step 3: Create a BgpPeer Object The BgpPeer object is used to configure the peer (BIRD machine) BGP properties on Porter.\n  Run the following command to create a YAML file for the BgpPeer object:\nvi porter-bgp-peer.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\napiVersion:network.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2kind:BgpPeermetadata:name:porter-bgp-peerspec:conf:peerAs:50001neighborAddress:192.168.0.5NOTE\nFor details about the fields in the BgpPeer YAML configuration, see Configure Peer BGP Properties Using BgpPeer.    Run the following command to create the BgpPeer object:\nkubectl apply -f porter-bgp-peer.yaml   Step 4: Create an Eip Object The Eip object functions as an IP address pool for Porter.\n  Run the following command to create a YAML file for the Eip object:\nvi porter-bgp-eip.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\napiVersion:network.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2kind:Eipmetadata:name:porter-bgp-eipspec:address:172.22.0.2-172.22.0.10NOTE\nFor details about the fields in the Eip YAML configuration, see Configure IP Address Pools Using Eip.    Run the following command to create the Eip object:\nkubectl apply -f porter-bgp-eip.yaml   Step 5: Create a Deployment The following creates a deployment of two pods using the luksa/kubia image. Each pod returns its own pod name to external requests.\n  Run the following command to create a YAML file for the deployment:\nvi porter-bgp.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\napiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:porter-bgpspec:replicas:2selector:matchLabels:app:porter-bgptemplate:metadata:labels:app:porter-bgpspec:containers:- image:luksa/kubianame:kubiaports:- containerPort:8080  Run the following command to create the deployment:\nkubectl apply -f porter-bgp.yaml   Step 6: Create a Service   Run the following command to create a YAML file for the service:\nvi porter-bgp-svc.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\nkind:ServiceapiVersion:v1metadata:name:porter-bgp-svcannotations:lb.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1:porterprotocol.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1:bgpeip.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2:porter-bgp-eipspec:selector:app:porter-bgptype:LoadBalancerports:- name:httpport:80targetPort:8080externalTrafficPolicy:ClusterNOTE\n You must set spec.type to LoadBalancer. The lb.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1: porter annotation specifies that the service uses Porter. The protocol.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1: bgp annotation specifies that Porter is used in BGP mode. The eip.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2: porter-bgp-eip annotation specifies the Eip object used by Porter. If this annotation is not configured, Porter automatically uses the first available Eip object that matches the protocol. You can also delete this annotation and add the spec.loadBalancerIP field (for example, spec.loadBalancerIP: 172.22.0.2) to assign a specific IP address to the service. In the BGP mode, you can set spec.loadBalancerIP of multiple services to the same value for IP address sharing (the services are distinguished by different service ports). In this case, you must set spec.ports.port to different values and spec.externalTrafficPolicy to Cluster for the services. If spec.externalTrafficPolicy is set to Cluster (default value), Porter uses all Kubernetes cluster nodes as the next hops destined for the service. If spec.externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local, Porter uses only Kubernetes cluster nodes that contain pods as the next hops destined for the service.     Run the following command to create the service:\nkubectl apply -f porter-bgp-svc.yaml   Step 7: Verify Porter in BGP Mode The following verifies whether Porter functions properly.\n  In the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command to obtain the external IP address of the service:\nkubectl get svc   In the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command to obtain the IP addresses of the cluster nodes:\n  On the BIRD machine, run the following command to check the routing table. If equivalent routes using the Kubernetes cluster nodes as next hops destined for the service are displayed, Porter functions properly.\nip route If spec.externalTrafficPolicy in the service YAML configuration is set to Cluster, all Kubernetes cluster nodes are used as the next hops.\nIf spec.externalTrafficPolicy in the service YAML configuration is set to Local, only Kubernetes cluster nodes that contain pods are used as the next hops.\n  On the BIRD machine, run the following command to access the service:\ncurl 172.22.0.2   ","excerpt":"This document demonstrates how to use Porter in BGP mode to expose a service backed by two pods.

Each pod returns its own pod name to external requests.\n  Run the following command to create a YAML file for the deployment:\nvi porter-layer2.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\napiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:porter-layer2spec:replicas:2selector:matchLabels:app:porter-layer2template:metadata:labels:app:porter-layer2spec:containers:- image:luksa/kubianame:kubiaports:- containerPort:8080  Run the following command to create the deployment:\nkubectl apply -f porter-layer2.yaml   Step 5: Create a Service   Run the following command to create a YAML file for the service:\nvi porter-layer2-svc.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\nkind:ServiceapiVersion:v1metadata:name:porter-layer2-svcannotations:lb.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1:porterprotocol.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1:layer2eip.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2:porter-layer2-eipspec:selector:app:porter-layer2type:LoadBalancerports:- name:httpport:80targetPort:8080externalTrafficPolicy:ClusterNOTE\n You must set spec.type to LoadBalancer. The lb.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1: porter annotation specifies that the service uses Porter. The protocol.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1: layer2 annotation specifies that Porter is used in Layer 2 mode. The eip.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2: porter-layer2-eip annotation specifies the Eip object used by Porter. If this annotation is not configured, Porter automatically uses the first available Eip object that matches the protocol. You can also delete this annotation and add the spec.loadBalancerIP field (for example, spec.loadBalancerIP: 192.168.0.91) to assign a specific IP address to the service. If spec.externalTrafficPolicy is set to Cluster (default value), Porter randomly selects a node from all Kubernetes cluster nodes to handle service requests. Pods on other nodes can also be reached over kube-proxy. If spec.externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local, Porter randomly selects a node that contains a pod in the Kubernetes cluster to handle service requests. Only pods on the selected node can be reached.     Run the following command to create the service:\nkubectl apply -f porter-layer2-svc.yaml   Step 6: Verify Porter in Layer 2 Mode The following verifies whether Porter functions properly.\n  In the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command to obtain the external IP address of the service:\nkubectl get svc porter-layer2-svc   In the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command to obtain the IP addresses of the cluster nodes:\nkubectl get nodes -o wide   In the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command to check the nodes of the pods:\nkubectl get po NOTE\nIn this example, the pods are automatically assigned to different nodes. You can manually assign pods to different nodes.    On the client machine, run the following commands to ping the service IP address and check the IP neighbors:\nping 192.168.0.91 ip neigh In the output of the ip neigh command, the MAC address of the service IP address 192.168.0.91 is the same as that of worker-p001 192.168.0.3. Therefore, Porter has mapped the service IP address to the MAC address of worker-p001.\n  On the client machine, run the following command to access the service:\ncurl 192.168.0.91 If spec.externalTrafficPolicy in the service YAML configuration is set to Cluster, both pods can be reached.\nIf spec.externalTrafficPolicy in the service YAML configuration is set to Local, only the pod on the node selected by Porter can be reached.\n  ","excerpt":"This document demonstrates how to use Porter in Layer 2 mode to expose a service backed by two pods. …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/usage/use-porter-in-layer-2-mode/","title":"Use Porter in Layer 2 Mode"},{"body":"This document describes how to configure Porter in BGP mode for Kubernetes cluster nodes deployed under multiple routers. You can skip this document if all Kubernetes cluster nodes are deployed under the same router.\nNOTE\nThis document applies only to the BGP mode. The Layer 2 mode requires that all Kubernetes cluster nodes be on the same Layer 2 network (under the same router).  Network Topology Before Configuration This section explains why you need to perform the configuration. The following figure shows the network topology of a Kubernetes cluster before the configuration.\nIP addresses in the preceding figure are examples only. The topology is described as follows:\n In the Kubernetes cluster, the master and worker 1 nodes are deployed under the leaf 1 BGP router, and the worker 2 node is deployed under the leaf 2 BGP router. Porter is only installed under leaf 1 (by default, only one Porter replica is installed). A service backed by two pods is deployed in the Kubernetes cluster, and is assigned an IP address 172.22.0.2 for external access. Pod 1 and pod 2 are deployed on worker 1 and worker 2 respectively. Porter establishes a BGP connection with leaf 1 and publishes the IP addresses of the master node and worker 1 (192.168.0.3 and 192.168.0.4) to leaf 1 as the next hop destined for the service IP address 172.22.0.2. Leaf 1 establishes a BGP connection with the spine BGP router and publishes its own IP address 192.168.0.2 to the spine router as the next hop destined for the service IP address 172.22.0.2. When an external client machine attempts to access the service, the spine router forwards the service traffic to leaf 1, and leaf 1 load balances the traffic among the master node and worker 1. Although pod 2 on worker 2 can also be reached over kube-proxy, router-level load balancing is implemented only among the master node and worker 1 and the service bandwidth is limited to the bandwidth of the master node and worker 1.  To resolve the problem, you need to label the Kubernetes cluster nodes and change the Porter deployment configuration so that Porter is installed on nodes under all leaf routers. In addition, you need to specify the spec.nodeSelector.matchLabels field in the BgpPeer configuration so that the Porter replicas establish BGP connections with the correct BGP routers.\nNetwork Topology After Configuration This section describes the configuration result you need to achieve. The following figure shows the network topology of a Kubernetes cluster after the configuration.\nIP addresses in the preceding figure are examples only. The topology is described as follows:\n After the configuration, Porter is installed on nodes under all leaf routers. In addition to what happens before the configuration, the Porter replica installed under leaf 2 also establishes a BGP connection with leaf 2 and publishes the worker 2 IP address 192.168.1.2 to leaf 2 as the next hop destined for the service IP address 172.22.0.2. Leaf 2 establishes a BGP connection with the spine router and publishes its own IP address 192.168.1.1 to the spine router as the next hop destined for the service IP address 172.22.0.2. When an external client machine attempts to access the service, the spine router load balances the service traffic among leaf 1 and leaf 2. Leaf 1 load balances the traffic among the master node and worker 1. Leaf 2 forwards the traffic to worker 2. Therefore, the service traffic is load balanced among all three Kubernetes cluster nodes, and the service bandwidth of all three nodes can be utilized.  Configuration Procedure Prerequisites You need to prepare a Kubernetes cluster where Porter has been installed. For details, see Install Porter on Kubernetes (kubectl and Helm) and Install Porter on KubeSphere (Web Console).\nProcedure NOTE\nThe node names, leaf router names, and namespace in the following steps are examples only. You need to use the actual values in your environment.    Log in to the Kubernetes cluster and run the following commands to label the Kubernetes cluster nodes where Porter is to be installed:\nkubectl label --overwrite nodes master1 worker-p002 lb.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1=porter NOTE\nPorter works properly if it is installed on only one node under each leaf router. In this example, Porter will be installed on master1 under leaf1 and worker-p002 under leaf2. However, to ensure high availability in a production environment, you are advised to installed Porter on at least two nodes under each leaf router.    Run the following command to scale the number of porter-manager pods to 0:\nkubectl scale deployment porter-manager --replicas=0 -n porter-system   Run the following command to edit the porter-manager deployment:\nkubectl edit deployment porter-manager -n porter-system   In the porter-manager deployment YAML configuration, add the following fields under spec.template.spec:\nnodeSelector:kubernetes.io/os:linuxlb.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1:porter  Run the following command to scale the number of porter-manager pods to the required number (change the number 2 to the actual value):\nkubectl scale deployment porter-manager --replicas=2 -n porter-system   Run the following command to check whether Porter has been installed on the required nodes.\nkubectl get po -n porter-system -o wide   Run the following commands to label the Kubernetes cluster nodes so that the Porter replicas establish BGP connections with the correct BGP routers.\nkubectl label --overwrite nodes master1 porter.kubesphere.io/rack=leaf1 kubectl label --overwrite nodes worker-p002 porter.kubesphere.io/rack=leaf2   When creating BgpPeer objects, configure the spec.nodeSelector.matchLabels field in the BgpPeer YAML configuration for each leaf router.
